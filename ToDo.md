# TO DELETE
Now update .gitignore to remove the JSON file entry:
Delete /public/data/projects.json file if it exists
Delete /public/data/ directory if empty
Delete api/regenerate-json.php (no longer needed)
Delete all older files:
    - projects-datatable jsonversion.js
    - api/projects jsonversion.php
    - projects-actions jsonversion.js
    - status-actions jsonversion.js
    - public/projects jsonversion.php

# Look and feel
✅ unifiy the Toasts desing  
✅  - optional add progress bar
- polish the tables 
✅- recreate the main menu
- add links to main apps (eft, remedy, sfdc)


# Features
- reports page -
        - export main reports
        - sql/ai agent queries
- adding a app stats page (admin/users) - to check hstorical load and response time of the app

# Security fixes
- HTML Escaping 

# General improvements
# Done ✅ - we'll stay in Hybrid MVC - 1. Adopt MVC Pattern Properly - Current Issue: Mix of direct SQL in controllers, inconsistent model usage. Benefits: Reusable queries, easier testing, cleaner separation

2. Implement Repository Pattern  - Current Issue: Direct database queries everywhere
Benefits: Centralized queries, easier to optimize, cacheable

✅3. Add Database Indexes  - Current Issue: Missing indexes on foreign keys and search columns
4. Optimize Queries - Current Issue: N+1 queries, missing JOINs

Add Caching Layer
 Implement Lazy Loading for DataTables  - Current Issue: Loading all data at once

 🏆 Top 5 Most Impactful Improvements:
1. Add Request/Response Classes (2 hours work) - Replace messy $_POST, json_decode everywhere with clean classes.
Impact: - Makes every API endpoint cleaner
2. Implement Repository Pattern (4 hours work) - Move all SQL queries to dedicated repository classes.
Impact: DRY principle, easier to optimize
3. Modularize JavaScript (6 hours work) - Split monolithic JS files into reusable modules.
Impact:  - Maintainability skyrockets
# Done ✅  4. Add Database Indexes (30 minutes!) - Simple SQL statements that make queries 10-100x faster. Impact: - Instant performance boost

💡 Most Surprising Issues I Found:
1. No caching - Dashboard makes same queries repeatedly
2. Loading all projects at once - Will break with 10,000+ projects
3. No bulk actions - Users must delete projects one by one
4. Regenerating JSON on every change - Unnecessary file I/O
5. Missing transaction isolation - Race conditions possible

🎓 Code Smells I Noticed:
php// ❌ SMELL #1: Repeating this everywhere
parse_str(file_get_contents("php://input"), $_PUT);

// ✅ SHOULD BE: One Request class
$request = new Request();

// ❌ SMELL #2: Same SQL in multiple files
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE company_project = ?

// ✅ SHOULD BE: Repository method
$repo->findByCompany($companyId);

// ❌ SMELL #3: Manual JSON escaping
echo json_encode(['data' => $projects], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);

// ✅ SHOULD BE: Response class
Response::json(['data' => $projects]);
